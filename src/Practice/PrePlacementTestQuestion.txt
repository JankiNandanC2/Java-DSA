Got it 👍. You currently have **two HackerRank contest problems open** in your browser:

1. **Problem Statement 41**
2. **TimeShift Tunnel**

Let me rewrite both in a **clear, detailed format** so you can practice them easily.

---

## 📝 Problem 1: Problem Statement 41

### Input Format
- **Customer Name** (string)
- **Car Brand** (string)
- **Booking Duration** (integer)
- **Phone Number** (10-digit integer)
- **Fuel Type** (string: `"electric"`, `"petrol"`, `"diesel"`)

### Output Format
- Generate a **License Key** using the following rules:
  - First 3 letters of the customer name (uppercase).
  - First 2 letters of the car brand (uppercase).
  - Booking duration (as-is).
  - Last 3 digits of the phone number.
  - Fuel type code:
    - `"electric"` → `E3`
    - `"petrol"` → `P1`
    - `"diesel"` → `D2`

- If the customer name contains **special characters**, output:
  ```
  Invalid License Key
  ```

### Sample Input / Output
```
Input:
John Tesla 5 9876543210 electric

Output:
JOH-TE-5-210-E3
```

```
Input:
Amy Ford 12 8765432101 petrol

Output:
AMY-FO-12-101-P1
```

```
Input:
K@ren BMW 7 7890123456 diesel

Output:
Invalid License Key
```

## 📝 Problem 2: TimeShift Tunnel

### Problem Description
You are managing a **queue system** for visitors entering a tunnel. Visitors can be of three types:
- **Gold** (highest priority)
- **Silver** (medium priority)
- **Regular** (lowest priority)

### Operations
1. `ARRIVE id type`
   - Add a visitor with ID and type (`gold`, `silver`, `regular`) to the queue.
2. `PROCESS`
   - Serve the next visitor based on priority rules:
     - Gold visitors are served before Silver and Regular.
     - Silver visitors are served before Regular.
     - Within the same type, serve in **arrival order**.
   - If the queue is empty and `PROCESS` is called, ignore it.

### Output Format
- Print the IDs of visitors in the order they are processed.

---

✅ So to summarize:
- **Problem Statement 41** → String manipulation + validation.
- **TimeShift Tunnel** → Queue simulation with custom priority rules.

Would you like me to also **write step-by-step solutions (code + explanation)** for both so you can directly practice them?
